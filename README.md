# HealthCare-Analytics
This project focuses on designing a dynamic dashboard to visualize and analyze patient wait list data in a healthcare system. The primary focus is on:

Wait List Comparison: Comparing current month's data with the previous year's figures.
Case Type Distribution: Visualizing the breakdown of patients by case type (outpatient, day case, inpatient).
Monthly Trends Analysis: Identifying variations in case numbers over time.
Patient Profiles: Studying patient distribution by age group and medical specialty.
Key Indicators: Highlighting critical metrics, such as average wait times by specialty.
